# Exercise 3-2
# Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just 
# printing each personâ€™s name, print a message to them. The text of each message 
# should be the same.

names = ['Ken', 'Kevin', 'Sarah']
print("Hello, " + names[0] + "! " + "Nice to see you again.")
print("Hello, " + names[1] + "! " + "Nice to see you again.")
print("Hello, " + names[2] + "! " + "Nice to see you again.")
